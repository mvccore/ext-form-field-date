## Features
- always server side checked attributes `required`, `disabled` and `readonly`
- all HTML5 specific and global atributes (by [Mozilla Development Network Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference))
- every field has it's build-in specific validator described above
- every build-in validator adds form error (when necessary) into session
  and than all errors are displayed/rendered and cleared from session on error page, 
  where user is redirected after submit
- any field is possible to render naturally or with custom template for specific field class/instance
- very extensible field classes - every field has public template methods:
	- `SetForm()`		- called immediatelly after field instance is added into form instance
	- `PreDispatch()`	- called immediatelly before any field instance rendering type
	- `Render()`		- called on every instance in form instance rendering process
		- submethods: `RenderNaturally()`, `RenderTemplate()`, `RenderControl()`, `RenderLabel()` ...
	- `Submit()`		- called on every instance when form is submitted
